<h1 >reflow</h1>

<p>Reflow is the browser performing the math to determine where to place the elements on a webpage. Evidently it effects the speed with which your browser can load the page. According to the guy in the video, you trade smoothness for speed with a webpage and should avoid too much depth in your DOM. I am trying to figure out what exactly that means.

    <p>I am not used to the speed with which web people expect things to work. I work with video and things are really big and take a long time to render. Web seems to work exactly the same way and it seems that people expect pages to load immediately. Come to think of it, so do I.
