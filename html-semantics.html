<h1 >Semantics of html-kayleen burke	</h1>

<p>We all know what a paragraph is when we look at it but what happens if we are unable to see the text and it has to be read to us? We can use a reader to facilitate ingesting a webpage but the reader will not be able to differentiate a paragraph from code. After a search, the text you are looking for may be in the 400th line. Imagine not being able to skim down to find that but having to wait to have the whole thing read to you. That will make for some really boring and confusing reading...unless we use semantics.
</p>
    <p>The semantics of html and css take basic text and tell computers, servers or readers to understand what that part of speech means. This can be a paragraph, heading or some code. By using html semantics you can enable searches to find all of the code in a website. Semantics instruct readers in a way that allows them to read more completely. If done properly, some readers can include the basic layout of the page like three columns and two rows.
