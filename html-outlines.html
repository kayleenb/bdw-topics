<p>I have to admit that reading the articles on outlines only served to confuse me. I had no problem with the concept in class. This is a common problem that I have run into. I try to read a technical article online and get lost then talk to someone who undestands it and then, Bam! I understand it. When it comes to organizing websites I can only compare them to authoring DVD's because that is my background.

    <p>The outline facilitates navigation. If you were to look at the content of a page on wikipedia, you might want to find information specifically on their early life. You wouldn't want to read through the entire page, would want to be able to jump to that point. Organization helps break down information into manageable and navigatable chunks.
