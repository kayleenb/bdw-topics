   <body>
<h1 >clearfix</h1>

<p>Clearfix is used to correct float collapse. It makes the float self clearing so that whatever follows will wrap the way it is supposed to. It evidently looks like:<code> <div style="float: left;" class="clearfix">Sidebar</div></code>
<!-- No Clearing div! --> .
</p>
    <p>It is my understanding that this is considered clumsy nowadays as is using floats. There seems to be a more elegent solution where one uses display:inline-block. Evidently, css newbies like myself are prone to using float as their basic layout element. Shame, shame.
