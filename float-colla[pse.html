<h1 >float-collapse	</h1>

<p>Float is the ability to set a block of text or an image to the left or right of the normal content. We see this all the time in magazines. It seems pretty straitforward until the floated item seems to hang over into the next body of text or images. This is called float collapse and is caused when the parent does not expand to enclose the floated chile. An example would be if an image is larger than the height of the parent content. It would appear to hang over the content below.
</p>
    <p>Float collaps can be fixed by using a clear property to remove the float from elements that follow it. This will allow the parent to wrap the floated item. For some reason this is considered an ineligent solution and using css is recomended but I didn't understand that part.
